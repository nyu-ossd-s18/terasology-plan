## April 5, 2018 
* We downloaded the code base
* We built the code with gradlew build
* We began to triage issues 
* We looked at bugs for beginners
* Some of us set up the code with IntelliJ using gradlew idea
* We looked at the code in IntelliJ
* We discussed the project change with the professor and took necessary steps to changing projects (renaming things, making repos in our project, creating milestones, etc.)
* We found issues we could work on as a group

## April 7, 2018 (Informal meeting to make progress on project)
* We played the game to have a better understanding of the controls
* We triaged issues 
* We recreated [Issue 3280](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/issues/3280)
* We reached out on the Terasology Discord channel/IRC to ask whether the game had a feature where the player can see themselves in 3rd person
* We discussed ways to solve the bug, left a comment asking for more guidance
* We updated milestones
* We are still having issues trying to run the program on Ubuntu

## April 10, 2018 
* Ryan had issues trying to install the program onto the computer, so he messaged the Discord chat
* Ashley messaged the Discord for clarification and more information on an issue, looked at closed issues for more information
* Dora:
    * looked for more potential issues that could be worked on as a team as well as smaller issues
    * recloned fork and set up properly with IntelliJ (cloned from the project the first time, then accidentally opened before running ./gradlew idea); 
* the three of us noticed the create game menu for both singleplayer and multiplayer got cut off, Dora looked through the UI files and made the menu scrollable but later Suyasha told us that people were already working on that issue. Dora is still looking for ways to improve upon their solution

* Suyasha and Ola were not in class but looked for more potential issues that can be done

## April 11, 2018
* Suyasha added a snow block and Dora added a new texture for the snow block but that might've been the incorrect interpretation of what they were asking for
* Suyasha and Ryan did some multiplayer testing
* Dora working on making the player light up when a torch is held, tried testing with Ashley but couldn't quite get it to work, more research required
* Suyasha found a new issue regarding snow that involves giving players random damage as they walk on the snow.
